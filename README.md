# Mobile-Applications
Mobile Applications I have made so far

1) Avalanche - First game I ever created. Uses accelerometer on mobile device to move player. Goal is to avoid the falling icicles as long as possible
2) Breakout - Classic arcade "Brick Breaker" game. I used different textures (using texture map/atlas) to indicate brick health and also added fancy mechanics to the player paddle.
3) Voice changer - iOS app that records your voice and allows you to play it back in either Slow, Fast, High pitched, or Low pitched. I used UIKits and AVAudioEngine to do this.
